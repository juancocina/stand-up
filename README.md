# FOR MAC
Short disclaimer, when automating the mac-script.py using 'Automator' on my mac, I had to run pip3 install scheduler.

This is one of the modules used to schedule the job to run every hour. For whatever reason, automator also wanted
an install...

# FOR WINDOWS 10
Using Windows built in Task Scheduler for now, will update soon...
