# FOR MAC
Short disclaimer, when automating the mac-script.py using 'Automator' on my mac, I had to run pip3 install scheduler.

This is one of the modules used to schedule the job to run every hour. For whatever reason, automator also wanted
an install...

# FOR WINDOWS 10
There was some trial and error with Windows Task Scheduler, there is a terminal that opens on boot, but I just give it a few seconds then close it. The program runs in the background.
